      <h2>Payment Terms</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Non-Transferable and Non-Refundable:</strong> All services purchased through LegacyAye are non-transferable and non-refundable. Once payment is made, it cannot be reversed, exchanged, or transferred to another person, course, or service. We believe in providing a committed and focused learning experience, so we encourage thoughtful consideration before purchasing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Our Commitment to You:</strong> At LegacyAye, your satisfaction is important to us. While we are unable to provide refunds under most circumstances, we are deeply committed to delivering exceptional value through our courses and services. We believe in transparency and are always available to help ensure you make the most out of your investment.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Refund Eligibility:</strong> Refunds may be issued if a course or service is officially canceled or discontinued by LegacyAye. In such an event, we will carefully evaluate your situation and, at our sole discretion, may issue a refund either as direct cash or credit toward another service of equal value. Your trust and satisfaction are paramount, and we aim to ensure that you are fully supported in these rare circumstances.
